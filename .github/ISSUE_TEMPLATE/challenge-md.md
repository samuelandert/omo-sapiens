# How do OMO-Challenges work?
OMO is the abbreviation for "open minded orginizationtalents". The OMO-Methodoloy is a very simple process definition which strives to enable decentralized organizations to continuously grow towards reaching their goals in many small iterative steps, while working remotely, asynchronously and hand-in-hand with a clear vision.
In order to stimulate creativity, engagement and fun, every challenge a group is trying to solve, is asked in form of the question of WHY. The more careful and the better the questions are posed, the better will the results and the following 5 process steps become, which can be re-cycled as many times needed: 

## 1. Learn about the purpose

### WHY questions - Why does this matter? What is your believe? Which experience and behavior do we want to inspire? 
_Try to understand and define the status experiences that hold you back and the feelings and experience you want to grow into. Try to become an expert by learning and gathering as much knowledge as possible_ 

**Status Quo experiences:**   

-

-

-

**Gainful experience we want to grown into:**

-

-

-


**Research Sources:**

___ 
## 2. Brainstorm & Ideate

### HOW questions - Specify clear actions to realize the defined purpose of why. How do we enable such experience and incentivize such behavior? 
_Try to generate the full spectrum of ideas and possibilities from as many perspectives as possible - the more the better_

**Ideas:**  
_be open about every additional idea and never break the magic seed of inspiration_

## 3. Prototype 

### WHAT questions - What do we need to do to achieve our purpose of why. Which prototypes are able to trigger the intended experience and behaviors in the best ways? 
_Try to find out what we need in order to get the ideas done, the more details you find the better. This is all about hands on, find the quickest possible way to prototype and test your assumptions; everything is allowed, be creative, mockups, pr√§sentations, games, interviews, polls and websites the more interactive the better_

___
## 4. Build & Implement

### WHO questions - Who is able to ship and deliver a full working proposal?
_Try to pull in the most suited collaborators to get the job done efficiently, with the goal to get one common proposal accepted by the broader community_

1. (e.g. Alice can you help us with writing)

2. (e.g. Bob can you help us with code)

3. (e.g. Charly can you help us with a presentation)

___
## 5. Vote on Proposals

a) Link to proposal A (github pull-request)

b) Link to proposal B (github pull-request)

c) Link to proposal C (github pull-request)

### Where questions - Where is this proposal leading us next?
_Try to judge the proposal based on its ability to incrementally improve over original intended experiences and incentivized behaviors. Accept or reject the proposals and adjust the prioritization of your next weeks challenges and roadmap accordingly, if needed consider to pivot radically on your current strategy_

**Accepted Proposals:**. 

- Proposal A 

- Proposal B

**Declined Proposals:**  
_Try to document as detailed as possible why the proposal was declined in order to learn and make it next time better_

- Proposal C
