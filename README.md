# omo-sapiens
or the so called open-minded-organisationtalents

## The history and future of omo-sapiens:
The omo-sapiens is an ancient old human species, whos origin is rooted 200.000 years way back in time. Omo-sapiens have been defined to be the very first humans showing characteristics of the modern homo-sapiens. 
In 2020, a breathtaking discovery comes a surprise, where freshly reborn omo-sapiens have been spotted, replicating themselves at an astonishing quick rate.  
OMOs live a fullfilling and thriving life in absolute abundance, with caring relationships and efficient resource sharing, contineously growing common wealth at an incredible fast pace through cultivating weekly innovation cycles. 

While studying and observing the daily habits of the OMO, we learned that they embrace the power of contineous change through a process we named the OMO-Circle. The OMO-Circle is an repetitive value and wealth generating machine, with an integrated process to incrementially update its own efficency. Recent observations show that OMO's seem to thrive in joy by just sharing five of their most precious intrinsic and well define goals for life with other OMO's. Magically those goals autodeploy into clear and self-adapting pathway's of challenges with longterm vision. Let's have a look into the weeklife of the OMO.

## The Omo-Circle
More to be documented once we get the chance of a clearer understanding of this process. 

### Monday
Monday morning OMO's have a look at their pathway and this weeks challenge. 
- information gathering, learn, study and teach

### Tuesday
- solution generating, prototyping, inspiring, copy and paste
- voting by feet by following your nose

### Wednesday
- Feedback and testing of Prototypes

### Thursday
- Implement the most promising prototypes

### Friday
- update the OMO-Circle process
- update of the priorisation of the future pathway challenges

### Weekend
- relax and enjoy the progress
